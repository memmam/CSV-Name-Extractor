# CSV-Name-Extractor
This is a simple C# applet I made for [Melody Nosurname](https://www.youtube.com/MelodyNosurname) after she complained about how tedious it is to manually extract member names from the CSV files generated by YouTube for paid channel members for her video outros.

All you need to do is drag and drop the CSV file onto the EXE, and it will spit out the list of members as a file `out.txt`, sorted alphanumerically with each member on their own line.

I hopee that people find this useful! <3
